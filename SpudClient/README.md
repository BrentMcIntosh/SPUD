# SPUD
**Single** **Page** Application   
Create Read **Update** **Delete**

1. The application must only use one page. 
2. No libraries on the front-end.     
3. The latest HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that Chrome handles are fine and encouraged.  
4. The app must run without error in Chrome (it may work in other browsers).
5. The application should work with the basic REST service of the ASP.NET MVC Music Store (where this rule is broken I make notes).
##### Rules I Broke
1. album-update.json is the data when the user adds or updates an album
